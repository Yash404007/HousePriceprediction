## Introduction

Predicting house prices is crucial in the real estate industry, helping buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions. This project employs XGBoost, a gradient-boosting algorithm known for its speed and performance, to build a regression model that predicts house prices with high accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes various features such as:
- Lot size
- Year built
- Location
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Square footage
- Condition of the house
- Neighborhood factors, etc.

### Source

The dataset can be obtained from the [Kaggle House Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) or any similar structured dataset.
